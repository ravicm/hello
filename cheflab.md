## Chef Lab:

#### **This part of Lab describes how to setup the Chef workstation and start creating workbooks and recipes**

##### Workstation:
### Create workstation
####  download  chef-workstation
From the **chef downloads** site https://downloads.chef.io/products/workstation  <br>
<img src="images/os-1.JPG" > <br>
select the OS and download the required version <br>
once download started, browser tab pause download and right click on the url, copy the link and run below command <br>
```js
#wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/chef-workstation/20.10.168/ubuntu/20.04/chef-workstation_20.10.168-1_amd64.deb
```
This will download the package to the workstation node
##### for ubuntu run below command to install chef, 
```js
#dpkg -i chef-workstation_20.10.168-1_amd64.deb
```
###### Once the chef is installed, verify the version with below command, to ensure it is installed
```js
#chef --version
```
**Create cookbooks directory later we create  all the cookbook**
#### #mkdir cookbooks

#### under cookbooks directory create cookbooks
## chef generate cookbook <cookbook-name>
#### #chef generate cookbook new-cookbook
After creating the chef cookbook, in the cookbook directory,  default files are created like, <br>
1. chefignore   --> ignore while update<br>
2. kitchen.yml for testing the cookbook <br>
3. metadata.rb     --> name,version,author of the cookbook <br>
4. readme          --> information about the cookbook, user group etc <br>
5. recipe         --> is the code file <br>
6. spec            --> for unit testing <br>
7. test            --> for integration test  <br>

### create recipe
#### chef generate recipe <recipe-name> <br>
### #chef generate recipe new-recipe <br>
which creates recipe file in default recipes directory <br>
##### Add the content into the recipe file  as show below <br>

### new-recipie.rb file is like below, which consists of code: <br>
file '/newfile' do             --> File name to be created and "do" means create <br>
content 'Chef new file'        --> Content in the file, after creation of the file, chef will place the content <br>
action :create                 --> Create the file <br>
end                            --> end of the task <br>

### To ensure no syntax error of the file 
```
#### #chef exec ruby -c new-cookbook/recipes/new-recipie.rb 

```
#### Run the chef-client to execute the recipe

```json
 #chef-client -zr "recipe[new-cookbook::new-recipe]"
```
#### On successful run it produces the output as

<ins>**Create Cher Server and attaching nodes** </ins> <br>

create account in manage.chef.io webseite which acts as chef server for workstation and nodes 
https://manage.chef.io/login <br>

create organization and add nodes, organization  discriminates types of nodes (like web, db etc) <br>
give name and shortname for the organization, this gives to a page where all the configurations are visible <br>
<img src="images/chef-Account.JPG" > <br>
Click on Administration, which displays all the organizations created <br>
Click on starter kit (left side)--> shows the download "starter kit" --> clicking on it  downloads starterkit  <br>
<img src="images/starter-kit.JPG" > <br>
It downloads into the local machine, which is a .rar file, click on the "chef-starter" to extract the files, and it consists of "chef-repo folder" <br>
click on chef-repo folder and it consists of <br>
folders, .chef, cookbooks,roles and files .gitignore and Readme. <br>
copy the folder chef-repo from local extracted folder  to chef workstation machine <br>
if local machine is windows use "winscp" <br>
<img src="images/chef-repo.JPG" > <br>
if local machine is linux use "scp"  <br>
 On chef workstation run below commands <br>
 
 ```
 # cd chef-repo
 ```
 #### to list all files including hidden files
 ```
 # ls -al 
 ```
 #### change directory to .chef
 ```js
 # cd .chef 
 ```
 which displays .config.rb  and the pem file( which is a private key)
 .config.rb consists of the url of chef server
 run the below command to verify the workstation connectivity to the server
 ```rb
# knife ssl check
```
 if the connection is successful, displays below message
 Connecting to host api.chef.io:443
Successfully verified certificates from `api.chef.io' 

Upon connecting the workstation to chef server, next step is to connect the nodes, to the server <br>
the process of connecting the node to server is called BOOTSTRAPPING <br>
the process bootstrapping ensures the server connectivity to the node by installing "chef client" and "ohai" <br>
chef-client is process ensures the node connectivity to the chef server to get updates <br>
ohai is the internal DB, which tells the chef-client about the status of the installations <br>

The essentials of creating the nodes <br>
If the nodes are in cloud, make sure the ssh is working, the node private key file(.pem file) is copied to workstation to enable secure connection (ssh/scp)<br>
The required ports are opened properly(port 22 for ssh and other application ports like port 80 for web etc.) <br>

To enable server to ssh to the node, make sure the private key of the node copied to workstation(though workstation don't directly to the node, copying the key 
into workstation enables ssh to the node <br>

**copy the nodes private key to workstation "chef-repo" directory** 
To create the chef-client on the node, run the below command  <br>

```rb
# knife bootstrap <node-ip> --ssh-user <user-name>  --sudo -i <privatekey.pem> -N node <node-name>
```

Example: <br>
```rb
# knife bootstrap x5.2xx.2x.x7 --ssh-user root --sudo -i priv.pem -N node node01
```

Once the command is run, if all the components in the command are correct, the output will be as below

```js
Are you sure you want to continue connecting  --> asks for confirmation
? (Y/N) Y   								  --> type Y

 Once the chef-client is successfully installed on the node, run the below command on chef-workstation <br>
 
 ```rb
 # knife node list
 ```
 The lists the nodes which has the chef client installed <br>
 
Initially during the setup of workstation the directory cookbooks is created and ran the various recipes like create file, install package and created webserver
This ensures the proper running of the packages and installations <br> 

after the downloading,  extracting the chef-repo  from server, the chef-repo will also consists of cookbooks <br>

the cookbooks in the chef-repo, all the next steps will happen from chef-repo cookbooks <br>

move the existing cookbooks from  ~cookbooks folder to ~chef-repo/cookbooks <br>
```rb
# mv ~cookbooks ~chef-repo/cookbooks
# rm -rf ~cookbooks
```
Just make sure delete only the old cookbooks <br>

Once the cookbooks are moved to the chef-repo directory, chef server need to be updated with the existing cookbooks, from next updates in the recipes in workstation
will update the server and server updates the clients(nodes) <br>

upload the cookbook with following command <br>

```
# knife cookbook upload <cookbookname>
```
Example: <br>
```
# knife cookbook  upload new-cookbook01
```
uploads the cookbook new-cookbook01 to server <br>
On server website, click on policy the uploaded cookbook is visible <br>
next step is run the uploaded recipe of the cookbook on node, with below command <br>

```
# knife node run_list set <chef-node> "recipe[cookbook-name::recipe-name]"
```
example:

```
# knife node run_list set chef-node01 "recipe[new-cookbook01::new-recipe]"
```

To verify the recipe in runlist, run the below command <br>

```
# knife node show <node-name>
```
Example:

```
# knife node show chef-node01
```

The output of the command will be like below <br>
```rb
# chef-node01:
  run_list: recipe[new-cookbook01::new-recipe]
root@chef-wrokstation01:~/chef-repo/cookbooks/new-cookbook01/recipes# knife node show chef-node01

```

on server web page, select the node and click on edit-runlist, which displays the runlists <br>

Next time when the recipe is updated, run the below command on chef-workstation <br>

```rb
 #knife cookbook upload <cookbook-name>
 ```
 This uploads the recipe to server, then run the below command again on the client to update recipe on client <br>
 
 ```rb
  # chef-client
 ```
 #### Once the chef-client is run, the output will be as below

 Till now the manual process of the upload of recipes to chef-clients is discussed <br>


Automate the process, so that the recipe updates will update the client automatically <br>

update the cron tab to run the command chef-client at specified time (minutes,hours,days etc.)<br>

in the crontab file add the details as below <br>
```
* * * * *  <user>  chef-client
```
Example:<br>

```rb
* * * * *  root  chef-client
```

This will run the chef every specified time and update the node. However it is not a good idea to automate the workstation <br>
